🌐 AgentZero Class - Interface Agent for Interactive Financial Advisory App
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Technical Overview:
AgentZero serves as the primary interface agent within the advisory app's agentic pipeline. It is the main 
agent with which clients interact, gathering user inputs and contextualizing data from downstream agents 
(such as summary reports and risk profiles). This agent’s role is pivotal in managing the conversation 
flow, integrating information from other agents, and delivering responses that feel coherent and tailored 
to the client’s needs. As AgentZero processes information from multiple agents, it’s essential to manage 
the amount of data passed through to avoid generating hallucinations. The architecture considers this 
potential limitation by defining a boundary on how many downstream agents can inform AgentZero’s 
responses, ensuring clarity and accuracy in interactions.

In Simple Terms:
AgentZero is the client-facing agent that interacts directly with users. It combines information from 
other agents, like risk profiles and research summaries, with user input to provide meaningful, informed 
responses. This setup ensures that AgentZero can be easily updated without overloading the conversation 
with unnecessary data, maintaining accurate and relevant advice.

Attributes:
- Inherits all attributes from AgentBase, including model_name, api_key, and prompter.

Methods:
- get_mandate: Retrieves the agent’s mandate from a text file, defining rules for user interactions.
- generate_response: Prepares and sends a conversation prompt to the model, incorporating the mandate, 
  user input, and optional data (e.g., report summaries) to produce a well-rounded, personalized response.
